# Rifle-analysis-program
Two rifle manufacturers will be competing in an upcoming event. One of the manufacturers is a
U.S. company that produces the U_1 rifle having a 0.6096 m barrel, a 7.62 mm bore, and 0.102
mm deep rifling grooves. The other is a Mexican company that produces the M_1 rifle having a
0.4826 m barrel, 8.5 mm bore, and 0.100 mm deep rifling grooves. The lead bullet used weighs
0.0956 N in both rifles. The gas pressure build-up during the firing of the rifle, which is the driving
force of the bullet, is known for the two rifles. The gas pressure varies as the bullet travels along
the barrel of the rifle. The pressure data are given in the following table. The frictional resistance
exerted on the bullet is to be considered small as compared to the propulsive force of the gas on
the bullet, and the cross-sectional area of the rifling grooves is considered negligible.
This C++ computer program calculates the bullet velocities, accelerations along the barrel and along its 
trajectory until it hits the ground, given a table of pressure values 

This program will calculate:

1.The maximum height that a bullet will reach if there is no air drag. Assuming that rifles
are fired at an angle from the horizontal. Vary this angle from 25 to 55 with
increments of 10 degrees.
2. The time it takes for the bullet to travel the length of the barrel.
3. The total distance traveled by the bullet, i.e. the range of the bullet.
4. The time-lapse before the bullet strikes the ground, measured from the firing time.
5. Plots of velocity, acceleration, and trajectory of the bullet. 
6. A table summarizing items 1 to 4 so that the two rifles could be compared.
8. List of classes and their structures. Note that at least two classes containing public
and private sections should be used in the program.

The arrays are be declared dynamically in the heap area and are deleted
once computations are done.
